### 1. Why are some commenly used python packages (e.g., [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)) are missing?

Commonly used packages have already been installed in UFRC, see https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Python. However, python need to be loaded before using:

```
ml python
```

### 2. How to submit a job?
   - Create a file named `run.sh` (or whatever you want but the extension should be `.sh`) including the following content. You can use a tool like [vi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLCCqzwHB5s) for file creation.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=nf_samples # You can change nf_samples to whatever name you want
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL # Use ALL or NONE
#SBATCH --mail-user=xinsongdu@ufl.edu # Change this to your own email address
#SBATCH --ntasks=20 # Number of CPUs you allocate to your task
#SBATCH --mem=200gb # Number of memory you allocate to your task
#SBATCH --account=djlemas # UFRC account name
#SBATCH --qos=djlemas-b # Which quota of the account you want to use
#SBATCH --time=20:00:00 # Maximum running time of the task
#SBATCH --output=nf_samples%j.log # Log file of the task, you can change nf_samples to whatever name you want
pwd; hostname; date

# load modules (use ml command to load modules you need)

# code (shell code you want to execute)

date
```

   - Run your code (replace `run.sh` with your own sbatch file name if the name is incorrect)

```
$ sbatch run.sh
```

### 3. How to submit a job with software container such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/)?
   - [Create a Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/), [build and push](https://medium.com/@deepakshakya/beginners-guide-to-use-docker-build-run-push-and-pull-4a132c094d75) it to [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/)
   - [pull your needed singualarity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-pull)
   - Go through FAW #2, load [singularity module](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Singularity) with `ml singularity` and use [singularity run](https://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-run) as your code.
